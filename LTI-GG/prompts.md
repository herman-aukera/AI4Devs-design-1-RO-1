## 🤖 Main System Generation Prompt

### Initial Architecture & Documentation Prompt

````
# 🤖 Prompt for GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT — LTI ATS MVP Generator

Act as a **senior fullstack functional engineer** and **AI prompt engineer**. Your job is to generate a complete, bootable **MVP of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** for the startup **LTI**, applying Clean Architecture, DDD, and TDD.

This project will serve as a real-world academic showcase of prompt-based software development with modern technologies and functional programming.

## 🎯 Objective

Generate a **fully working and testable MVP** for an ATS platform that includes:

1. 📄 System description with key features and differentiators
2. 🧠 Lean Canvas diagram to model the business
3. ✅ 3–5 fully documented use cases + 1 diagram per use case
4. 🧱 Entity-Relationship data model (names, types, relationships)
5. 🏛️ High-level architecture (text + diagram)
6. 🔍 C4 diagram for a selected core component (e.g., Candidate Pipeline)
7. 📂 All output must be in `lti/LTI-GG/`, with main doc `LTI-GG.md` and prompts in `prompts.md`

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Elm (Elm Architecture) + `elm-css`
- **Backend**: Elixir + Phoenix
- **Database**: In-memory (ETS, Agent, Mnesia – choose what's fastest to configure and easiest to test)
- **Auth**: Dummy login (`admin/admin123`) stored in frontend localStorage

## 📐 Architecture

- Modular Clean Architecture with:
  - **Domain** layer: pure business logic, types, rules
  - **Application** layer: use cases, orchestration
  - **Infrastructure**: in-memory persistence, adapters
  - **Web**: Phoenix routes, API adapters for Elm
- Elm follows **pure functional programming** (no side effects in logic)
- Use Elm **ports** where JS interop is needed
- Elixir uses `@spec`, modules per context, and idiomatic FP patterns

## 🧪 Testing

- All functionality must be test-driven:
  - Unit tests for: Elm update/model logic + Elixir domain & app logic
  - Integration tests: Elixir API + Elm ↔ backend interactions
- Include coverage setup (≥80%) and `make test` target

## 📄 Output Requirements

The result of this prompt must generate a complete working project that:

- ✅ Follows DDD, TDD, and Clean Architecture strictly
- ✅ Has full docs (`LTI-GG.md`) and diagrams (ASCII or Mermaid OK)
- ✅ Has commit-based modular delivery (one commit per use case/layer)
- ✅ Has strong DX: `make setup`, `make run`, `make test`, etc.
- ✅ Starts with documentation → then tests → then passing code

## 🛠️ Expected Commands

```bash
make setup         # Install all dependencies
make run           # Start frontend + backend servers
make test          # Run all tests
make format        # Format all code
make reset-db      # Reset in-memory store if needed
````

🔒 **Constraints**:

- No external DBs or complex setup
- No JS/TS — frontend is Elm only
- No untested logic — all must be TDD-driven
- No skipped layers — every use case must pass through domain, app, infra, and web

📌 **Final Notes**: If anything is ambiguous (e.g., DB lib, login UX, Elm->Elixir ports), ask before coding. Do not omit diagrams or docs. Ensure the project boots with zero errors.

This prompt must produce a fully working ATS MVP with solid architecture, great developer experience, clean code, and test coverage.
